# Contributing to AI Recruitment Assistant

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

* We use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code formatting
* We use [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) for import sorting
* We use [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) for linting
* We use [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) for type checking

Before submitting your code, please run:

```bash
# Format code
black .

# Sort imports
isort .

# Lint code
flake8 src/ tests/

# Type check
mypy src/

# Run tests
pytest tests/
```

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
