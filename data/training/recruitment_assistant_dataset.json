The system was built with JavaScript and deployed on AWS, but response times were unacceptable during peak usage. I approached this systematically by first implementing comprehensive monitoring and profiling to identify bottlenecks. I discovered that the issue was a combination of inefficient database queries and inadequate caching strategies. I redesigned the data access layer, implemented Redis caching, and optimized several key algorithms. The result was a 70% reduction in response time and improved system reliability. This experience reinforced my passion for system optimization and the importance of data-driven problem solving."
